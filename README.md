# Android Photo Capture App That Sends Images to Firebase

This is a personal project that I built to learn a bit of Kotlin and get familiar with Android Studio. 

It is a native Android app that captures images and then uploads them to Firebase.

If you want to use this, you will need to add your own Firebase credentials.
